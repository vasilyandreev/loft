			<h1> The Way of the Loft </h1>
			<hr>
			<p> 1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe in helping to foster deeper connections between everyone in the Loft. And we believe limits can produce incredible content. That’s why at the Loft you can only post three things a week. <br><br>
			    2. &nbsp; &nbsp;  Love is a strong word. But sometimes you’ll come across something that will resonate with you very deeply. For those posts, go ahead, love them -- just remember you can only love one post a day. <br><br>
			    3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like any other party, the Loft can go a lot of ways as it progresses. You’ll decide how interesting it is, how cool it is, and how deeply you connect with those around you. Seize the opportunity to help create a completely new way of interacting. <br><br>
