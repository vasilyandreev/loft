			<h1> How Loft Works </h1>
			<hr>
			<p>
				1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We believe in helping to foster deeper connections between everyone in the Loft. And we believe limits can produce incredible content. That’s why on Loft you can only post three things a week. <br><br>
				2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Love is a strong word. But sometimes you’ll come across something that will really resonate with you. For those posts, go ahead, love them -- just remember you can only love one post a day. <br><br>
				3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Be active. Loft isn't a place to just scroll through content, but to really engage and reconnect with yourself and all the awesome people in the world. Post. Comment. Message. Be yourself and you can do no wrong. <br><br>
